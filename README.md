# github-events-viewer
Displays events from `http://api.github.com/users/{name}/events` - that means including events on your private repos.
Useful if you need to remember what you did yesterday :-)

Github itself does provide only your public actions page: https://github.com/zbycz?tab=activity.


- **[LIVE VERSION v1.2](https://cdn.rawgit.com/zbycz/github-events-viewer/v1.2/github-event-viewer.html)** (cached forever on cdn.rawgit.com so nobody could hackily get the token)
- [master branch demo](https://rawgit.com/zbycz/github-events-viewer/master/github-event-viewer.html)
- former part of [OctoMate chrome extension](https://github.com/rubyerme/chrome-github-mate#octo-mate) (formerly Github Mate)
