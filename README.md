# github-events-viewer
Displays events from http://api.github.com/users/{name}/events - that means including events on your private repos.

Github itself does provide only your public actions page: https://github.com/zbycz?tab=activity.

- [master branch demo](https://rawgit.com/zbycz/github-events-viewer/master/github-event-viewer.html)
- "part" of [OctoMate chrome extension](https://github.com/rubyerme/chrome-github-mate#octo-mate) (formerly Github Mate)
